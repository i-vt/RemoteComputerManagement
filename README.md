# RCM — Remote Computer Management

A modular command-and-control framework written in Rust.

## Features

- **Multi-transport**: Raw TLS, TCP, named pipes, HTTP(S) with proxy support
- **Malleable profiles**: Traffic shaping to mimic legitimate services (Slack, Google Drive, CDN)
- **Fallback resilience**: 4 strategies (priority, round-robin, random, failover) with per-endpoint profiles
- **Multi-operator**: Role-based access (admin/operator/viewer), per-operator audit trail
- **Dynamic listeners**: Create, start, stop listeners from the panel without server restart
- **Job system**: Background task execution with streamed output
- **In-memory execution**: PE loader, BOF runner, .NET CLR hosting
- **Process migration**: Spawn or inject into another process
- **Evasion**: AMSI/ETW patching, ntdll unhooking, direct/indirect syscalls, heap encryption, fiber-based stack spoofing
- **Artifact management**: Timestomping, secure deletion, NTFS alternate data streams
- **Pivoting**: TCP and SMB named pipe pivot listeners with multi-hop chains
- **Auto-recon**: Commands that fire automatically on every new session
- **Web panel**: 10 pages, keyboard shortcuts, dark/light theme, toast notifications, webhook alerts

## Quick Start

```bash
# Build server
cargo build --release --bin server

# Run (creates admin account on first run)
./target/release/server

# Build an agent
cargo run --bin builder -- \
  --host <C2_IP> --port 4443 --transport tls --platform linux

# Open panel/index.html in a browser, login with printed credentials
```
